Operator is used to perform all the logical or calculative type work,
there are two things in the Operator operator and the operandes.
there are multiple type of operator in the dart,
2+3 here the 2,3 are the operandes and the the + is the operator.

types of the operator:

1: Arithmetic operator
2: Increment and the decrement operator
3: Assignment Operator
4: Logical Operator
5: Type test operandes

******************Arithmetic Operator *************************************

Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are the most common types of operators. They perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.

Operator Symbol	Operator Name	Description
+	   Addition	For adding two operands
-	    Subtraction	For subtracting two operands
-expr	Unary Minus	For reversing the sign of the expression
*	    Multiplication	For multiplying two operands
/	    Division	For dividing two operands and give output in double
~/	    Integer Division	For dividing two operands and give output in integer
%	    Modulus	Remainder After Integer Division

******************Increment and the decrement Operator *************************************

Increment and Decrement Operators
With increment and decrement operators, you can increase and decrease values. If ++ is used at the beginning, then it is a prefix. If it is used at last, then it is postfix.

Operator Symbol	Operator Name	Description
++var	Pre Increment	Increase Value By 1. var = var + 1 Expression value is var+1
--var	Pre Decrement	Decrease Value By 1. var = var - 1 Expression value is var-1
var++	Post Increment	Increase Value By 1. var = var + 1 Expression value is var
var--	Post Decrement	Decrease Value By 1. var = var - 1 Expression value is var
 Info
Note: ++var increases the value of operands, whereas var++ returns the actual value of operands before the increment.

******************Assignment Operator *************************************

Assignment Operators
It is used to assign some values to variables. Here, we are assigning 24 to the age variable.

int age = 24;
Operator Type	Description
=	Assign a value to a variable
+=	Adds a value to a variable
-=	Reduces a value to a variable
*=	Multiply value to a variable
/=	Divided value by a variable

******************Relational Operator *************************************

Relational Operators
Relational operators are also called comparison operators. They are used to make a comparison.

Operator Symbol	Operator Name	Description
>	Greater than	            Used to check which operand is bigger and gives result as boolean
<	Less than	                Used to check which operand is smaller and gives result as boolean
>=	Greater than or equal to	Used to check which operand is bigger or equal and gives result as boolean
<=	Less than or equal to	    Used to check which operand is smaller or equal and gives result as boolean
==	Equal to	                Used to check operands are equal to each other and gives result as boolean
!=	Not equal to	            Used to check operand are not equal to each other and gives result as boolean


******************Logical Operator *************************************

Logical Operators
It is used to compare values.

Operator Type	Description
&&	This is ‘and’, return true if all conditions are true
||	This is ‘or’. Return true if one of the conditions is true
!	This is ’not’. return false if the result is true and vice versa


******************type test Operator *************************************


Type Test Operators
In Dart, type test operators are useful for checking types at runtime.

Operator Symbol	Operator Name	Description
is	is	Gives boolean value true if the object has a specific type
is!	is not	Gives boolean value false if the object has a specific type
